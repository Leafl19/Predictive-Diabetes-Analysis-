# Predictive-Diabetes-Analysis-

**Overview**
This project analyzes the relationship between various health indicators (Glucose, BMI, Age, etc.) and the likelihood of diabetes.The dataset contains patient data, including health indicators such as glucose levels, blood pressure, and age, along with the diabetes outcome (whether or not a patient is diabetic)

**Structure of Analysis**:

**data**:

 **scripts**: SQL queries for the data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations
 
 **visualizations/**: Tableau Dashboard


## Key Visualizations
- **Bar chart**: Showing AVG Glucose,BMI,BP,AGE by Diabetes Outcome
- **Average Glucose by Outcome**: A bar chart showing the average glucose levels for diabetic and non-diabetic patients.
- **Scatter Plo** : Showing Gluclose v BMI and the outcome based off the two indicstors 

## Key Findings and Insights
- **Glucose Levels**: Diabetic patients have significantly higher glucose levels compared to non-diabetic patients. 
- **Age and Diabetes**: Older patients have a higher likelihood of being diabetic compared to younger patients.
- **BMI Impact**: Higher BMI is associated with a higher chance of diabetes, but the correlation is weaker than for glucose levels.

## Recommendations
**Target High-Risk Groups**: Focus interventions on older patients with high glucose and BMI levels to prevent diabetes.
 **Promote Health Screenings**: Encourage routine health check-ups to monitor glucose levels, especially in patients over 50 years old.
 **Dietary and Lifestyle Changes**: Weight management programs for patients with elevated BMI to reduce the risk of diabetes.
