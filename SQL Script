Here is my SQL scrip on how i found my insights to make my analysis 

for the table part insert the name of the table you chose to make it in your SQL

-- 1. Average Glucose Levels by Diabetes Outcome
SELECT 
    Outcome, 
    AVG(Glucose) AS avg_glucose
FROM insert the table name you name it
GROUP BY Outcome;

-- 2. Average BMI by Diabetes Outcome
SELECT 
    Outcome, 
    AVG(BMI) AS avg_bmi
FROM insert the table name you name it
GROUP BY Outcome;

-- 3. Average Blood Pressure by Diabetes Outcome
SELECT 
    Outcome, 
    AVG(BloodPressure) AS avg_blood_pressure
FROM insert the table name you name it
GROUP BY Outcome;

-- 4. Average Age by Diabetes Outcome
SELECT 
    Outcome, 
    AVG(Age) AS avg_age
FROM your_table
GROUP BY Outcome;

-- 5. Count of Patients by Diabetes Outcome (Diabetic vs. Non-Diabetic)
SELECT 
    Outcome, 
    COUNT(*) AS total_patients
FROM insert the table name you name it
GROUP BY Outcome;

-- 6. Glucose Distribution by Outcome
SELECT 
    Glucose, 
    Outcome, 
    COUNT(*) AS count
FROM insert the table name you name it
GROUP BY Glucose, Outcome
ORDER BY Glucose;

-- 7. Count of Diabetic and Non-Diabetic Patients by Age Group
-- Create age groups: Under 30, 30-50, and Above 50
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN Age < 30 THEN 'Under 30'
        WHEN Age BETWEEN 30 AND 50 THEN '30-50'
        ELSE 'Above 50'
    END AS Age_Group,
    Outcome,
    COUNT(*) AS count
FROM insert the table name you name it 
GROUP BY Age_Group, Outcome
ORDER BY Age_Group;

-- 8. BMI Distribution by Outcome
SELECT 
    BMI, 
    Outcome, 
    COUNT(*) AS count
FROM insert the table name you name it 
GROUP BY BMI, Outcome
ORDER BY BMI;

-- 9. Detailed Summary for Glucose, BMI, Age, and Blood Pressure
SELECT 
    Outcome, 
    AVG(Glucose) AS avg_glucose, 
    AVG(BMI) AS avg_bmi, 
    AVG(Age) AS avg_age, 
    AVG(BloodPressure) AS avg_blood_pressure,
    MIN(Glucose) AS min_glucose, 
    MAX(Glucose) AS max_glucose,
    MIN(BMI) AS min_bmi, 
    MAX(BMI) AS max_bmi,
    MIN(Age) AS min_age, 
    MAX(Age) AS max_age,
    MIN(BloodPressure) AS min_bp, 
    MAX(BloodPressure) AS max_bp
FROM insert the table name you name it GROUP BY Outcome;
